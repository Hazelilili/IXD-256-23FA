### Formatting Tips  
   
To format text into separate lines or paragraphs with [markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), include at least 2 spaces at the end.  The extra spaces act as line breaks.  

Links can be inserted with [link text in square brackets](link URL in parantheses).  For example, the markdown for [link to this page](./README.md) on GitHub is:  
`[link to this page](./README.md)`  
  
To insert images, the syntax is almost the same with the addition of exclamation point `!` before [image description in square brackets] followed by (image link in parentheses).  The image below is included with:  
`![led blink circuit](../class02/led_blink_bb.png)` syntax.  
  
![blink led circuit](../class02/led_blink_bb.png)
